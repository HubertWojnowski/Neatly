# Neatly
Neatly is a simple project, which I have created to practice my SCSS skills. 

 It is a landing page for a data management analytics program. It was supposed to be simple and without unnecessary effects, because it's all about data. It's already complicated. I also wanted it to look modern and nice, because everyone deserves to work with nice-looking software.
I forgot to say... it is fully responsive!

 In the future, I plan to improve the quality of the code and work on the fine details on the site.

STAY TUNED!!
 
 I was strongly inspired by this dribble design.
