Project Name: Neatly Analytics Landing Page

Description:
Neatly Analytics Landing Page is a modern, minimalist landing page created as a side project by a junior frontend developer. This page aims to present an analytical program used for data management in a clear and user-friendly manner. The project was implemented using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. Additionally, the SASS preprocessor was utilized for more efficient style management. The project is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to various devices and screen resolutions.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS (including SASS)
JavaScript
 
 I was strongly inspired by this dribble design.
